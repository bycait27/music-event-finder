Music Exploration is a website that is focused on giving you an easy to access, clear way of finding more music. If you have the name of an artist, you can search their name and find more music from them. If you're feeling more adventurous, you can use our random genre generator.

For the bootcamp, this is our first group project. It's focused on javascript/APIs, but there are also elements that we learned from week 1 that are essential for this project. 

Our group consisted of Caitlin Ash, Jack Stendeback, and Alex Blaylock. As a group we had a lot of obstacles. Like other groups, we found a lot of unforeseen problems with the APIs and had to pivot our project a lot. 

Some other obstacles we faced we were a lot more standard, we faced problems trying to fetch our APIs, making a L&D mode, and overall just had a lot of trial and error processes.
